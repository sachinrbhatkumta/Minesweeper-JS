Minesweeper JS
==============

A simple clone of Windows Minesweeper, designed to be run on mobile touch devices (desktop browsers work too). Tested on iPhone, iPad, Google Chrome.

It can be run without a server just by opening the file public/index.html in a browser; the root folder has a Sinatra static file server config.

*   Attribution for images (all CC-BY)
*   Bug when you have less flags than mines(!)
