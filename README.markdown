Minesweeper JS
==============

A simple clone of Windows Minesweeper, designed to be run on mobile touch devices (desktop browsers work too). Tested on iPhone, iPad, Google Chrome.

It can be run without a server just by opening the file index.html in a browser; otherwise you just need a server that can handle static files and navigate to the webapp root.
